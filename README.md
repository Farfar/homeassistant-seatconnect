# Skoda Connect - A Home Assistant custom component for Skoda Connect/MyÅ KODA

# v1.0.30-RC7
**WARNING!**
***Version 1.0.30 and later has undergone major code changes since release 1.0.27.
If you are updating, be sure to backup all your data***
Major changes are entity names and climate entitys are removed.

## This is fork of [robinostlund/homeassistant-volkswagencarnet](https://github.com/robinostlund/homeassistant-volkswagencarnet) modified to support Skoda Connect/MySkoda through native app API

### What is working
- odometer and service info
- fuel level, range, adblue level
- lock, windows, trunk, hood, sunroof and door status
- last trip info
- position - gps coordinates, if vehicle is moving, time parked
- electric engine related information - charging, battery level, plug connected and more
- electric climatisation and window_heater information
- start/stop auxiliary climatisation for PHEV cars
- start/stop electric climatisation and window_heater
- lock/unlock car
- parking heater heating/ventilation (for non-PHEV cars)
- requests information - latest status, requests remaining until throttled
- device tracker - entity is set to 'not_home' when car is moving
- trigger data refresh - for status changes where car doesn't report it automatically to server (for example car was unlocked on the garden and you just lock it) it still shows old status until car will upload new status or status is refreshed app

### What is NOT working / under development
- climate entitites has been removed since they didn't map very well for requests to Skoda Connect API.

### Breaking changes
- Combustion heater/ventilation is now named parking heater so it's not mixed up with aux heater for PHEV
- Many resources have changed names to avoid confusion in the code, some have changed from sensor to switch and vice versa
- Major code changes has been made for requests handling.
  - request_in_progress is now a binary sensor instead of a switch
  - force_data_refresh is a new switch with the same functionality as "request_in_progress" previously, it will force refresh data from car

## Installation

### Install with HACS (recomended)
If you have HACS (Home Assistant Community Store) installed, just search for Skoda Connect and install it direct from HACS.
HACS will keep track of updates and you can easly upgrade to the latest version when a new release is available.

If you don't have it installed, check it out here: [HACS](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/custom-component-hacs)

### Manual installation
Clone or copy the repository and copy the folder 'homeassistant-skodaconnect/custom_component/skodaconnect' into '<config dir>/custom_components'

## Configure

Add a skodaconnect configuration block to your `<config dir>/configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
skodaconnect:
    username: <username for skoda connect>
    password: <password for skoda connect>
    spin: <S-PIN for skoda connect>
    scandinavian_miles: false
    scan_interval:
        minutes: 1
    name:
        wvw1234567812356: 'Kodiaq'
```
* **username:** (required) the username to your Skoda Connect account

* **password:** (required) the password to your Skoda Connect account

* **spin:** (optional) required for supporting combustion engine heating start/stop.

* **scandinavian_miles:** (optional) set to true if you want to change from km to mi on sensors. Conversion between fahrenheit and celcius is taken care of by Home Assistant. (Default: false)

* **scan_interval:** (optional) specify in minutes how often to fetch status data from Skoda Connect. (Default: 5 min, minimum 1 min)

* **name:** (optional) map the vehicle identification number (VIN) to a friendly name of your car. This name is then used for naming all entities. See the configuration example. (by default, the VIN is used). VIN need to be entered lower case


Additional optional configuration options, only add if needed:
```yaml
    response_debug: False

## Automations

In this example we are sending notifications to an ios device. The Android companion app does not currently support dynamic content in notifications (maps etc.)

Save these automations in your automations file `<config dir>/automations.yaml`

### Get notification when your car is on a new place and show a map with start position and end position
```yaml
- id: notify_skoda_position_change
  description: Notify when position has been changed
  alias: Skoda position changed notification
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: device_tracker.kodiaq
  action:
    - service: notify.ios_my_ios_device
      data_template:
        title: "Kodiaq Position Changed"
        message: |
          ðŸš— Skoda Car is now on a new place.
        data:
          url: /lovelace/car
          apns_headers:
            'apns-collapse-id': 'car_position_state_{{ trigger.entity_id.split(".")[1] }}'
          push:
            category: map
            thread-id: "HA Car Status"
          action_data:
            latitude: "{{trigger.from_state.attributes.latitude}}"
            longitude: "{{trigger.from_state.attributes.longitude}}"
            second_latitude: "{{trigger.to_state.attributes.latitude}}"
            second_longitude: "{{trigger.to_state.attributes.longitude}}"
            shows_traffic: true
```

### Announce when your car is unlocked but no one is home
```yaml
- id: 'notify_skoda_car_is_unlocked'
  alias: Skoda is at home and unlocked
  trigger:
    - entity_id: binary_sensor.vw_carid_external_power
      platform: state
      to: 'on'
      for: 00:10:00
  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: lock.kodiaq_door_locked
      state: unlocked
    - condition: state
      entity_id: device_tracker.kodiaq
      state: home
    - condition: time
      after: '07:00:00'
      before: '21:00:00'
  action:
    # Notification via push message to smartphone
    - service: notify.device
      data:
        message: "The car is unlocked!"
        target:
          - device/my_device
    # Notification via smart speaker (kitchen)
    - service: media_player.volume_set
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.kitchen
        volume_level: '0.6'
    - service: tts.google_translate_say
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.kitchen
        message: "My Lord, the car is unlocked. Please attend this this issue at your earliest inconvenience!"
```

## Enable debug logging
For comprehensive debug logging you can add this to your `<config dir>/configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
    default: info
    logs:
        skodaconnect.connection: debug
        skodaconnect.vehicle: debug
        custom_components.skodaconnect: debug
        custom_components.skodaconnect.climate: debug
        custom_components.skodaconnect.lock: debug
        custom_components.skodaconnect.device_tracker: debug
        custom_components.skodaconnect.switch: debug
        custom_components.skodaconnect.binary_sensor: debug
        custom_components.skodaconnect.sensor: debug
 ```
* **skodaconnect.connection:** Set the debug level for the Connection class of the Skoda Connect library. This handles the GET/SET requests towards the API

* **skodaconnect.vehicle:** Set the debug level for the Vehicle class of the Skoda Connect library. One object created for every vehicle in account and stores all data.

* **skodaconnect.dashboard:** Set the debug level for the Dashboard class of the Skoda Connect library. A wrapper class between hass component and library.

* **custom_components.skodaconnect:** Set debug level for the custom component. The communication between hass and library.

* **custom_components.skodaconnect.XYZ** Sets debug level for individual entity types in the custom component.
