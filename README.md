# Seat Connect - A Home Assistant custom component for Seat Connect

## This is fork of [lendy007/homeassistant-skodaconnect](https://github.com/lendy007/homeassistant-skodaconnect) modified to support Seat
This integration for Home Assistant will fetch data from VAG connect servers related to your Seat Connect enabled car.
Seat Connect never fetch data directly from car, the car sends updated data to VAG servers on specific events such as lock/unlock, charging events, climatisation events and when vehicle is parked. The integration will then fetch this data from the servers.
When vehicle actions fails or return with no response, a force refresh might help. This will trigger a "wake up" call from VAG servers to the car.
The scan_interval is how often the integration should fetch data from the servers, if there's no new data from the car then entities won't be updated.

### Supported setups
This integration will only work for your car if you have Seat Connect functionality. Cars using other third party, semi-official, mobile apps won't work.

The car privacy settings must be set to "Share my position" for full functionality of this integration. Without this setting, if set to "Use my position", the sensors for position (device tracker), requests remaining and parking time might not work reliably or at all. Set to even stricter privacy setting will limit functionality even further.

### What is working, all cars
- Automatic discovery of enabled functions (API endpoints).
- Charging plug connected
- Charging plug locked
- Charger connected (external power)
- Battery level
- Electric range
- Start/stop charging
- Start/stop Electric climatisation, window_heater and information
- Charger maximum current (untested)
- Set departure timers (untested)
- Odometer and service info
- Fuel level, range, adblue level
- Lock, windows, trunk, hood, sunroof and door status
- Last trip info
- Position - gps coordinates, if vehicle is moving, time parked
- Start/stop auxiliary climatisation for PHEV cars
- Lock and unlock car
- Parking heater heating/ventilation (for non-electric cars)
- Requests information - latest status, requests remaining until throttled
- Device tracker - entity is set to 'not_home' when car is moving
- Trigger data refresh - this will trigger a wake up call so the car sends new data

### Under development and BETA functionality (may be buggy)
- Model image url
- Config flow multiple vehicles from same account
- Service calls

### What is NOT working
- Switches doesn't immediately update "request results" and "request_in_progress". Long running requests will not show up until completed which might take up to 3-5 minutes.
- Config flow convert from yaml config

### Breaking changes
- Changed configuration from yaml to config flow for version >1.1.0. Please remove all yaml configuration and use integration config in HASS UI.
- Combustion heater/ventilation is now named parking heater so it's not mixed up with aux heater for PHEV
- Many resources have changed names to avoid confusion in the code, some have changed from sensor to switch and vice versa. Sensors with trailing "_km" in the name has been renamed to "_distance" for better compability between imperial and non-imperial units.
- Major code changes has been made for requests handling.
  - request_in_progress is now a binary sensor instead of a switch
  - force_data_refresh is a new switch with the same functionality as "request_in_progress" previously, it will force refresh data from car

## Installation

### Install with HACS (recomended)
If you have HACS (Home Assistant Community Store) installed, add this github repo as a custom repository and install.
HACS will keep track of updates and you can easly upgrade to the latest version when a new release is available.

If you don't have HACS installed, check it out here: [HACS](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/custom-component-hacs)

### Manual installation
Clone or copy the repository and copy the folder 'homeassistant-seatconnect/custom_component/seatconnect' into '<config dir>/custom_components'

## Configure

Configuration in configuration.yaml is now deprecated and can interfere with setup of the integration.
To configure the integration, go to Configuration in the side panel of Home Assistant and then select Integrations.
Click on the "ADD INTEGRATION" button in the bottom right corner and search/select seatconnect.
Follow the steps and enter the required information. Because of how the data is stored and handled in Home Assistant, there will be one integration per vehicle.
Setup multiple vehicles by adding the integration multiple times.

### Configuration options
The integration options can be changed after setup by clicking on the "CONFIGURE" text on the integration.
The options available are:

* **Poll frequency** The interval (in seconds) that the servers are polled for updated data(1000 Requests per day limitation by VWGROUP. so min 120 seconds).

* **S-PIN** The S-PIN for the vehicle. This is optional and is only needed for certain vehicle requests/actions (auxiliary heater, lock etc).

* **Mutable** Select to allow interactions with vehicle, start climatisation etc.

* **Full API debug logging** Enable full debug logging. This will print the full respones from API to homeassistant.log. Only enable for troubleshooting since it will generate a lot of logs.

* **Resources to monitor** Select which resources you wish to monitor for the vehicle.

* **Distance/unit conversions** Select if you want to convert distance/units.


## Automations

In this example we are sending notifications to an ios device. The Android companion app does not currently support dynamic content in notifications (maps etc.)

Save these automations in your automations file `<config dir>/automations.yaml`

### Use input_select to change pre-heater duration
First create a input_number, via editor in configuration.yaml or other included config file, or via GUI Helpers editor.
It is important to set minimum value to 10, maximum to 60 and step to 10. Otherwise the service call might not work.
```yaml
# configuration.yaml
input_number:
  pheater_duration:
    name: "Pre-heater duration"
    initial: 20
    min: 10
    max: 60
    step: 10
    unit_of_measurement: min
```
Create the automation, in yaml or via GUI editor.
```yaml
# automations.yaml
- alias: Set pre-heater duration
  trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: input_number.pheater_duration
  action:
  - service: seatconnect.set_pheater_duration
    data_template:
     vin: <VIN-number of car>
     duration: >
        {{ trigger.to_state.state }}
```

### Get notification when your car is on a new place and show a map with start position and end position
Note: only available for iOS devices since Android companion app does not support this yet.
This might be broken since 1.0.30 when device_tracker changed behaviour.
```yaml
- id: notify_seat_position_change
  description: Notify when position has been changed
  alias: Seat position changed notification
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: device_tracker.arona
  condition: template
    condition: template
    value_template: "{{ trigger.to_state.state != trigger.from_state.state }}"
  action:
    - service: notify.ios_my_ios_device
      data_template:
        title: "Arona Position Changed"
        message: |
          ðŸš— Seat Car is now on a new place.
        data:
          url: /lovelace/car
          apns_headers:
            'apns-collapse-id': 'car_position_state_{{ trigger.entity_id.split(".")[1] }}'
          push:
            category: map
            thread-id: "HA Car Status"
          action_data:
            latitude: "{{trigger.from_state.attributes.latitude}}"
            longitude: "{{trigger.from_state.attributes.longitude}}"
            second_latitude: "{{trigger.to_state.attributes.latitude}}"
            second_longitude: "{{trigger.to_state.attributes.longitude}}"
            shows_traffic: true
```

### Announce when your car is unlocked but no one is home
```yaml
- id: 'notify_seat_car_is_unlocked'
  alias: Seat is at home and unlocked
  trigger:
    - entity_id: binary_sensor.arona_external_power
      platform: state
      to: 'on'
      for: 00:10:00
  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: lock.arona_door_locked
      state: unlocked
    - condition: state
      entity_id: device_tracker.arona
      state: home
    - condition: time
      after: '07:00:00'
      before: '21:00:00'
  action:
    # Notification via push message to smartphone
    - service: notify.device
      data:
        message: "The car is unlocked!"
        target:
          - device/my_device
    # Notification via smart speaker (kitchen)
    - service: media_player.volume_set
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.kitchen
        volume_level: '0.6'
    - service: tts.google_translate_say
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.kitchen
        message: "My Lord, the car is unlocked. Please attend this this issue at your earliest inconvenience!"
```

## Enable debug logging
For comprehensive debug logging you can add this to your `<config dir>/configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    seatconnect.connection: debug
    seatconnect.vehicle: debug
    custom_components.seatconnect: debug
    custom_components.seatconnect.climate: debug
    custom_components.seatconnect.lock: debug
    custom_components.seatconnect.device_tracker: debug
    custom_components.seatconnect.switch: debug
    custom_components.seatconnect.binary_sensor: debug
    custom_components.seatconnect.sensor: debug
 ```
* **seatconnect.connection:** Set the debug level for the Connection class of the Seat Connect library. This handles the GET/SET requests towards the API

* **seatconnect.vehicle:** Set the debug level for the Vehicle class of the Seat Connect library. One object created for every vehicle in account and stores all data.

* **seatconnect.dashboard:** Set the debug level for the Dashboard class of the Seat Connect library. A wrapper class between hass component and library.

* **custom_components.seatconnect:** Set debug level for the custom component. The communication between hass and library.

* **custom_components.seatconnect.XYZ** Sets debug level for individual entity types in the custom component.
